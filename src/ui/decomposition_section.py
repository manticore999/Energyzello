- The trend graph helps you see if your data is generally increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.
- If the line goes up, your data is rising; if it goes down, itâ€™s falling. Focus on the overall direction, not short-term bumps.
- Understanding the trend is crucial for long-term forecasting and business planning.

- Peaks and valleys that repeat at regular intervals mean your data has seasonality. This is important for choosing models that can handle such patterns.
